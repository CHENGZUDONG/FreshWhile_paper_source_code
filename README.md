## Design and implement  FreshWhile
### Blockchain-IoT System for Fresh Produce Traceability
Novel blockchain-based mobile system prototype that facilitates complete end-to-end tracking of the fresh AgriFood supply chain logistics. By integrating blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, FreshWhile offers an end-to-end traceability solution, guaranteeing the freshness of the produce from `farm to fork'. Although the architecture is designed for ease of deployment, FreshWhile demonstrates low-cost, low-power, and low-complexity characteristics, making it suitable for real-world mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose a unique approach to determine the freshness of the product considering the best date before use, along with the temperature and humidity of the product during transit. We explore and exploit blockchain advances and grasp potential advantages to improve the performance of AgriFood logistics. The proposed blockchained AgriFood system presents a promising opportunity to boost transparency and traceability, decrease fraud and waste, and enhance AgriFood safety. Our implementation of the FreshWhile concept in Android is at good technical readiness level (TRL) and readily available for mobile devices.
Several TRL challenges have been addressed during both implementation and design, including implementation cost, scalability, and interoperability. The evaluation of the proposed FreshWhile architecture and the mobile application validates key aspects considered during design and presents impeding research directions with recommendations.

The implementation and experiment of FreshWhile have been fully conducted by **Chuan Wai** Fong as a part of his mastersin School of IT, Deakin University under the supervision of **Shiva Pokhrel and Chengzu Dong**.

## Features
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensures secure and transparent tracking of produce.
- **IoT Enabled**: Utilizes IoT sensors to monitor temperature and humidity in real-time.
- **Freshness Calculation**: Novel algorithm to calculate the freshness based on various parameters.
- **Low Cost and Complexity**: Designed for easy deployment with minimal costs and technical complexity.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Enables stakeholders to view the condition and location of their produce during transit.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/CHENGZUDONG/FreshWhile_paper_source_code
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files.
4. Run the application on your device or emulator.

## Usage
- **Farmers and Suppliers**: Register produce and update transit conditions.
- **Logistics Providers**: Monitor and update environmental conditions during transit.
- **Consumers**: Check the freshness and origin of the produce.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: For immutable record-keeping and transparency.
- **IoT**: Sensors for real-time data collection.
- **Android Studio**: For developing the mobile application interface.

## Challenges and Research
While Freshwhile demonstrates the potential of blockchain in food nutrition delivery, it also acknowledges challenges in cost, scalability, and interoperability. Future research is directed towards:
- Reducing operational costs.
- Enhancing scalability for larger networks.
- Improving interoperability with different blockchain platforms and IoT devices.
