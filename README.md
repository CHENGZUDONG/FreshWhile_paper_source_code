# Freshwhile: Blockchain-IoT System for Fresh Produce Traceability

## Introduction
Freshwhile is a groundbreaking system that leverages Blockchain and IoT technologies to trace the delivery of fresh produce from the farm to the consumer. This system aims to ensure the freshness of produce by tracking environmental conditions during delivery and calculating the produce's freshness based on its best before use date, temperature, and humidity.

## Features
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensures secure and transparent tracking of produce.
- **IoT Enabled**: Utilizes IoT sensors to monitor temperature and humidity in real-time.
- **Freshness Calculation**: Novel algorithm to calculate the freshness based on various parameters.
- **Low Cost and Complexity**: Designed for easy deployment with minimal costs and technical complexity.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Enables stakeholders to view the condition and location of their produce during transit.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/CHENGZUDONG/FreshWhile_paper_source_code
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files.
4. Run the application on your device or emulator.

## Usage
- **Farmers and Suppliers**: Register produce and update transit conditions.
- **Logistics Providers**: Monitor and update environmental conditions during transit.
- **Consumers**: Check the freshness and origin of the produce.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: For immutable record-keeping and transparency.
- **IoT**: Sensors for real-time data collection.
- **Android Studio**: For developing the mobile application interface.

## Challenges and Research
While Freshwhile demonstrates the potential of blockchain in food nutrition delivery, it also acknowledges challenges in cost, scalability, and interoperability. Future research is directed towards:
- Reducing operational costs.
- Enhancing scalability for larger networks.
- Improving interoperability with different blockchain platforms and IoT devices.
